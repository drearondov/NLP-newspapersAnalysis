# Newspapers Analysis Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for my NLP project. This project allow for NLP
analysis of Newspaper Headlines found in the tweets of 12 of the main newspapers
of Per√∫. The analysis is mainly on the aspects that can allow us to see changes
in the narrative, and how do the changes affect the engagement of the users.

To organise the project I used `Kedro`, and divided the process into 6 pipelines:

1. Data Retrieval
1. Cleaning and Preprocessing
1. EDA
1. Feature Engineering
1. Sentiment Analysis
1. Topic Modeling

In the Following figure you can see how the pipelines are organized and how they
move the data though each one of the nodes.
